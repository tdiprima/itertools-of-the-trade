# 🛠️ Itertools of the Trade

*Generators? Infinite. Coffee? Also infinite.* ☕️ 🚀

Welcome to **Itertools of the Trade**, a chill little lab for Python wizards who love iterables, generators, and all things lazy-evaluated.  
This repo's packed with bite-sized scripts that show how to bend the `itertools` module (and a little `functools`) to your will — from chaining and grouping data to building infinite loops that never quit.

Whether you're learning, teaching, or just vibing with Python's most underrated module — you're in the right place.

## 🧠 What's Inside

Each script is short, readable, and focused on one itertools superpower at a time.
Use them as reference, inspiration, or just a quick "ohhh that's how that works" moment.

| Script                  | What It Shows                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pairs_without_self.py` | The humble nested loop for pair generation.                                |
| `efficient_pairs.py`    | Pair generation, but make it ✨efficient✨ with `product()`.                 |
| `merge_lists.py`        | Combine multiple lists into one seamless iterator using `chain()`.         |
| `infinite_sequences.py` | How to safely play with infinite iterators (without freezing your laptop). |
| `group_data.py`         | Grouping by key with `groupby()` like a data wrangler.                     |
| `team_combinations.py`  | Build your dream teams using `permutations()` and `combinations()`.        |
| `chain_react.py`        | Chains, filters, and reduces — a functional pipeline in motion.      |
| `infinite_looping.py`   | The fancy one: grouping, accumulating, and transforming data like a boss.  |

## ⚙️ Why It Exists

Because `itertools` deserves main character energy.  
These examples show that you can do *so much* with pure Python — no pandas, no NumPy, no drama.

## 💡 Pro Tip

Try running these scripts in a REPL or Jupyter Notebook — watch the iterators unfold live.  
You'll start seeing loops differently 👀
