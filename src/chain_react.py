"""
Blending itertools and functools for functional-style data processing.

This script:
1. Chains multiple iterables into one.
2. Filters out unwanted elements.
3. Maps a transformation over the results.
4. Reduces the final iterable into a single value.

Think of it like a mini, pure-Python data pipeline.
